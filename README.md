# Personal Finance Planning: Goals-Based Asset Allocation (GBAA) for Portfolio Management

## Overview

This report focuses on personal finance planning, which involves understanding the client's needs through an **Investment Policy Statement (IPS)**. 
The **Black-Litterman model** is used to estimate the expected returns, while the **DCC-Copula GARCH** model is applied to estimate the covariance matrix for each asset class (Cash, Equity, Investment-grade Bonds, High-yield Bonds, and REITs). 
Portfolio allocation is then carried out using the **Goals-Based Asset Allocation (GBAA) method**, where a set of pre-optimized modules is used to identify the module best suited for each specific client goal. 
Subsequently, sub-portfolios are created within each asset class to further optimize the performance of the allocated assets. The portfolio outperformed its benchmark by 8.39% (15.09% vs. 6.70%).
